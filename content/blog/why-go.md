## First contact
It's been about 8 years since I started playing with Go. At that moment I met a colleague who had left my workplace to try his luck at a new challenge in his professional career. One day talking to him he told me that they had decided to use a programming language called Go and that he was delighted with how easy it was to do things that with Java, the language we were used to using, was tremendously crude and sometimes complex, due to to the number of layers and repetitions you have to add. That's when I told him to show me how it worked and where I met Go.

I tried making some API with an HTTP server and in a matter of minutes I had it running and launching curls without any problem. That same year, a few months later, I had the opportunity to participate in an operational automation project where he worked and we did it by setting up several APIs in Go.
