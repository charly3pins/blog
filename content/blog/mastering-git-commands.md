[Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git) is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system. Being a distributed revision control system means that each developer has each own copy of the project’s history locally, not like centralized ones that all developers have to point to the “one and only” server (like SVN). For that reason Git is faster than others, because almost everything is performed locally instead of remote calls to the centralized revision control server. Each repo provides a separato working tree with project files for each developer. Git’s branches model is one of the powerful tools it offers allowing to use branches for content switching making possible a flexible topic branch flow (e.g. feature branch or a hotfix branch).

All this power and flexibility implies a trade off (as always in our sector) and that's the difficulty of mastering all the commands that Git offers to work with; divided into high level commands and low level commands. I've been working with Git a few years now and sometimes it’s a bit confusing to use some commands and choose the correct one for the appropriate moment depending on your needs. 

For that reason I decided to create these series of posts in order to illustrate a bit some of them and try to bring more light into that sky. In the [official documentation page](https://git-scm.com/docs) they have a complete list of all commands available and a reference for them. I will stick to that categorization on my posts and group them in a similar way. I will explore the ones that I’ve used and the ones that I’ve considered are more useful to know how to work with. If I don’t cover a specific command that you wanna know in detail, please contact me and I will try to add it in a future revision of the series.
