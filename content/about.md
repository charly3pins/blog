Hi I'm Charly. I'm a developer interested in all related about programming, passionate of the newest technologies and willing to learn new things everyday. 

I'm focused in good practices and I try to improve the systems and code of the projects that I'm involved everyday. I believe in testing as the main thing of development and the CI/CD is a good ally for it.
