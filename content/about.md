title: "About me"
---

I'm Carles, but I'm known as Charly3Pins. For more than 10 years, I have been immersed in the exciting world of software engineering. Here I share my experiences, reflections and knowledge accumulated throughout this technological journey.

I have always liked solving problems and creating things. I remember as a child how what I liked most was being given Lego so that I could assemble my own designs, taking them apart again and again to create totally different things. When I started studying Computer Engineering, the truth is that I had not programmed anything before, but I had tinkered with computers, more to play and automate tasks in said games than anything else, but I already had that latent feeling that one day was going to surface. During that time is where I realized that I really wanted to dedicate myself to this.

Since I finished my studies I have worked in different sectors such as education, logistics or banking. The last few years in the fintech sector are where I have grown the most personally and professionally, facing challenges of all kinds and meeting exceptional people.

I consider myself an eternal learner, always thirsty for knowledge and eager to explore new technologies. Since I discovered [Go](https://go.dev/), I experienced an instant crush. This language embodies the [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) that I value so much, and I am excited to be part of its growth and evolution.

I love my job and when I finish my work day, I do sports to disconnect and recharge energy in addition to being with my family, and at night I usually continue studying to delve deeper into this wonderful world of technology. There is always something new to learn. Whether reading books, watching videos, taking courses or writing notes. Apart from that, the best way to learn is by doing things, not just seeing how they are done, so I dedicate time to creating projects or proofs of concept on topics that I want to delve into and master and then apply them in my work or future projects. You can see all my experiments on my [GitHub](https://github.com/charly3pins).
