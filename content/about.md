title: "Hey there!"

I’m **Carles**, also known as **Charly3Pins**. For over **12 years**, I’ve been diving headfirst into the amazing world of **software engineering**, and I’m here to share my adventures, thoughts, and all the cool stuff I'm learning along the way.

My journey has taken me from **software engineer** to **tech lead**, then to **engineering director**, and now to **CTO**. But no matter the title, I’ve always stayed hands-on with technology. As a CTO, I combine a **strategic vision** with a **hands-on engineering mindset** to drive impactful change. I’m passionate about solving complex problems, aligning technology with business goals, and delivering measurable results. I also thrive on building **high-performing teams**, mentoring talent, and creating environments where innovation can flourish.

I’m a **forever learner**, always curious and excited to explore new tech. I remember few years back when I discovered [Go](https://go.dev/), it was love at first sight. It’s simple, elegant, and just gets me—it’s like the **KISS Principle** ([Keep It Simple, Stupid!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)) in code form (it's true that after generics...).

When I’m not working, you’ll find me staying active doing exercise, spending time with my family, or diving into tech stuff. Yep, even after work, I’m usually learning—whether it’s through books, videos, courses, or just tinkering with new projects. I believe the best way to learn is by _doing_, so I’m always experimenting with new ideas and building things. You can check out all my experiments on my [GitHub](https://github.com/charly3pins).

Oh, and if you’re curious about how this blog works, feel free to peek under the hood in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/charly3pins/blog).
