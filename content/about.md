title: "Hey there!"

I’m Carles, aka Charly3Pins (C3P)—a Software Engineer (now CTO) with over 12 years diving into tech’s wild ride.
I grew up playing to build and assemble things with Lego; now I do it with code, solving problems and connecting systems that work.
I've gone from programming alone in my room to leading teams, but I still prefer being at the terminal rather than in a meeting room.
I'm passionate about solving complex challenges, making tech work for the business, and building successful teams—always in the trenches!

This blog’s my playground: thoughts, experiments, and stuff I’ve picked up along the way—usually with [Go](https://go.dev/).

When I’m not working, you’ll find me staying active doing exercise, spending time with my family, or diving into tech stuff.
Yep, even after work, I’m usually learning—whether it’s through books, videos, courses, or just tinkering with new projects.
I believe the best way to learn is by _doing_, so I’m always experimenting with new ideas and building things.
You can check out all my experiments on my [GitHub](https://github.com/charly3pins).
