title: "Hey there!"

I'm Carles, aka Charly3Pins (C3P)—a problem-solver and Software Engineer. For over 12 years, I've been diving deep into technical challenges, building systems that work, and figuring out why they don't when they break.

I grew up building things with Lego; now I do it with code, distributed systems, and teams.

I love solving problems that help others' lives; I enjoy understanding systems at every layer—from hardware to user experience;

I'm curious by nature and ambitious by choice, always seeking new challenges that push me to learn and grow.
Whether it's exploring new technologies, optimizing existing systems, or helping others level up their skills, I'm constantly experimenting and building.

This blog is my laboratory: technical deep-dives, experiments, and hard-won lessons—usually involving Go, distributed systems, and the occasional debugging war story.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me staying active, spending time with my family, or doing sports. I'm probably still learning something tech-related too. Books, courses, side projects—I believe the best way to understand something is to build it, break it, and build it again.

All my experiments and projects live on [GitHub](https://github.com/charly3pins).
