title: "Hey there! ðŸ‘‹"

Iâ€™m **Carles**, also known as **Charly3Pins**. For over **12 years**, Iâ€™ve been diving headfirst into the amazing world of **software engineering**, and Iâ€™m here to share my adventures, thoughts, and all the cool stuff I'm learning along the way.

My journey has taken me from **software engineer** to **tech lead**, then to **engineering director**, and now to **CTO**. But no matter the title, Iâ€™ve always stayed hands-on with technology. As a CTO, I combine a **strategic vision** with a **hands-on engineering mindset** to drive impactful change. Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems, aligning technology with business goals, and delivering measurable results. I also thrive on building **high-performing teams**, mentoring talent, and creating environments where innovation can flourish.

Iâ€™m a **forever learner**, always curious and excited to explore new tech. I remember few years back when I discovered [Go](https://go.dev/), it was love at first sight. Itâ€™s simple, elegant, and just gets meâ€”itâ€™s like the **KISS Principle** ([Keep It Simple, Stupid!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)) in code form (it's true that after generics...).

When Iâ€™m not working, youâ€™ll find me staying active doing exercise, spending time with my family, or diving into tech stuff. Yep, even after work, Iâ€™m usually learningâ€”whether itâ€™s through books, videos, courses, or just tinkering with new projects. I believe the best way to learn is by _doing_, so Iâ€™m always experimenting with new ideas and building things. You can check out all my experiments on my [GitHub](https://github.com/charly3pins).

Oh, and if youâ€™re curious about how this blog works, feel free to peek under the hood in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/charly3pins/blog).
