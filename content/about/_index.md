I believe in the power of clear communication and setting expectations establishing a foundation of trust and transparency with my team. 

I consider myself a born leader who wants to provide guidance, support, and a framework for collaboration, enabling everyone to thrive and achieve their best.

I started my journey as a Software Engineer and I still enjoy coding but I evolved as a mentor, coach, and guide for others. Like before, I am still hungry for new challenges and willing to learn new things every day. 

I'm an enthusiast of best practices as a way of success and you can find me as [@charly3pins](https://twitter.com/charly3pins) on Twitter.

I really like to learn new things almost everyday so I'm always reading books, listening podcasts or watching videos about tech. Also I want to put in practice all those learnings so I like creating PoC or side projects to try new things or investigate topics that I'm interested in. You can check my OSS projects in my [Github](https://github.com/charly3pins).

As a strong defender of the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), when I ran into [Go](https://golang.org/) some years ago... it was love at first sight! All that simplicity that I have been always defending, it was made reallity in a programming language. Since then, a long journey started that still don't finished. I'm still learning with the new versions and tools that are popping out almost every day. It has some limitations as it's a "new" programming language, but it's super exciting for me to live this growing and being lucky to actively participate, not just being an expectator interested on this technology.
