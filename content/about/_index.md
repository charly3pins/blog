Hello! 🙋🏻‍♂️ I'm Charly3Pins 

I'm a software engineer 👨🏻‍💻 hungry for challenges and willing to learn new things every day 🙇🏻‍♂️

I like the devops culture and researching different things focused in best practices 📜

Currently I'm working in Go 🐿️ as the main language, but not scared to learn or use another ones 🎉 

In my free time I like to play videogames 🎮, do some sports like running 🏃🏻, playing football ⚽ or gym workouts 🏋🏻‍♂️

Also I love walking with my dogs 🐕 and going to the mountain to disconnect from the city always I can 🌄
