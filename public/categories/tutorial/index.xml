      <description>I have to admit that I never liked the systems part of the development process. I always though that it was a job in a dark and creppy place, full of freaks doing a rare things. This vision completely changed when I started using Docker.

      <description>If you want to create a fast static website I recommend you Hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Go and it&amp;rsquo;s really use to configure and adapt to your needs. In addition, you can choose through different themes created by the team and others by the community or even create your own one.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explain in some steps how to create one blog with Hugo and how to be hosted &amp;amp; deployed in GitHub and GitHub Pages.</description>
