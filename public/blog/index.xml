      <description>I have to admit that I never liked the systems part of the development process. I always though that it was a job in a dark and creppy place, full of freaks doing a rare things. This vision completely changed when I started using Docker. On this point I realized that all the magic done in the sysadmin part was better than I though and then, I started intereseting more an more on this side.</description>

      <description>This is the first of a several articles I&amp;rsquo;m planning to write commenting the different exercises that I&amp;rsquo;m doing in Gophercises page.
 It&amp;rsquo;s a FREE course that will help you become more familiar with Go while developing your skills as a programmer. In the course we will build roughly 20 different mini-applications, packages, and tools that are each designed to teach you something different.
Gophercises I like playing with Go on this site because each exercise is focused in a set of packages of the language and the way of they are presented is really clear and easy to understand.</description>

      <description>If you want to create a fast static website I recommend you Hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Go and it&amp;rsquo;s really use to configure and adapt to your needs. In addition, you can choose through different themes created by the team and others by the community or even create your own one.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explain in some steps how to create one blog with Hugo and how to be hosted &amp;amp; deployed in GitHub and GitHub Pages.</description>
